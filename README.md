## Progress

Stage One:

*Understanding instructions*

    I must create an html, css, and javascript file. The quiz should be dynamically updating the html via javascript. I will need a second html for the high scores. Need to add a timer function on start. Need to add a function that removes time if answer is wrong. Create an end to the game on timer 0. Input for initials with recorded score.
